## Get Started
***
To get started with this repository, you will need to download the necessary software/applications if you don't already 
have them:
- **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)** - A platform used for developing and sharing machine learning and data 
science projects. It is an open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages. The modules required for 
this project are Pandas and Matplotlib.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)** - An integrated development environment (IDE) 
designed by Microsoft for writing, editing, debugging, and building code.

- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - A cloud-based platform that allows developers to store, manage, and share their 
code. Git is a free, open-source version control system used by GitHub to track changes in both small and large projects.

## Running this Repository
***
This repository can be **run locally** on your machine or using **GitHub Codespaces**.

### Running Locally
To run the repository locally, you will need Anaconda and Visual Studio Code installed as described above. 
Then follow the steps below:

- Clone repository: 
  `https://github.com/UWASIKLK/applied-statistics`

- Instal dependencies: 
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Open the `problems.ipynb` file in `Visual Studio Code` and run the notebook.

### GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows a user to code from any device with internet 
access. To start using codespaces, you'll need to have a personal GitHub account, which has a monthly quota of free use 
of GitHub code 
spaces. The codespace can be created directly from your GitHub repository or you can select an existing template. 

### Create GitHub Codespaces:

-	Clone the repository by using following link: `https://github.com/UWASIKLK/applied-statistics`
-	Navigate to your GitHub repository
-	Click on the green `<>Code` button on the right top side
-	Select `Create codespace on main`
